# This is a GitHub Actions workflow file.
# It defines a set of jobs that will be run automatically on every push or pull request
# to the repository, ensuring code quality and preventing regressions.

name: Run PHP Tests & Static Analysis

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    # The job will run on the latest version of Ubuntu.
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # This strategy block defines a build matrix.
    # FIX: The matrix now starts from PHP 8.2, which is the minimum version
    # required by the project's locked dependencies (PHPUnit 11).
    strategy:
      matrix:
        php-version: ['8.2', '8.3']

    steps:
      # Step 1: Check out the repository code.
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Set up the PHP environment for the current job.
      - name: Setup PHP v${{ matrix.php-version }}
        uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2
        with:
          php-version: ${{ matrix.php-version }}
          extensions: dom, mbstring
          coverage: xdebug

      # Step 3: Install Composer dependencies using the lock file.
      # This will now work consistently across all jobs in the matrix.
      - name: Install Composer dependencies
        run: composer install --prefer-dist --no-progress --no-suggest

      # Step 4: Run the PHPUnit test suite.
      - name: Run tests
        run: ./vendor/bin/phpunit

      # Step 5: Run PHPStan for static analysis (only on the latest PHP version).
      - name: Run static analysis
        if: matrix.php-version == '8.3'
        run: ./vendor/bin/phpstan analyse src tests --level=8

      # Step 6: Check for coding style violations (only on the latest PHP version).
      - name: Check coding style
        if: matrix.php-version == '8.3'
        run: composer cs
